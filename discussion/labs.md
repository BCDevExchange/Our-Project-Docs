#Lab

*Note: Labs should not be confused with current state lab.bcdevexchang.org as of March 2015*

**Release 1:** In support of the principles of open development and co-creation, it is proposed that the BCDevExchange website be enhanced to include a "labs" space. This labs area will allow members of the BCDevExchange to showcase and share functionality and content that is in the Inspiration and Exploration states, while providing some protection and coverage to those sharing in the lab. The lab, and its contents, will all be clearly labeled as being in the lab, with disclaimers and descriptions of what that means. 

In addition to providing a location and framework for the BCDevExchange to share ideas, concepts, functionality, and content being considered for the BCDevExchange.org itself, the lab is also intended to support other, non-BCDevExchange projects, giving them a safe place to evolve and share. 

The lab functionality will only be available to users who have signed up with the BCDevExchange. In early days, the lab area may be further limited to select users or groups as the lab idea is further defined and refined. Users should be able to navigate between BCDevExchange and its lab area after logging in. When entering the Lab area, the site will provide a message warning to the user that they are entering the lab, provide any required disclaimers, an overview of the state concepts used in the lab, and possibly a ‘what’s new in the lab’ summary. 

When interacting with any project within the BCDevExchange lab, the current state of each project, page, resource, or function should be clearly displayed to the user at all times, through the display of the appropriate state tag (Inspiration, Exploration, or Delivery). 

##Proposed Solution

A very distinct Lab area will be created. The lab area exists separate to BCDevExchange.org, though is only accessible to users who are signed up and logged in to BCDevExchange. This lab area will provide an area where many different projects / code / applications can exist, including a lab version of BCDevExchage.org. The lab will provide some tools to users, such as an instance of CKAN (for catalogue / data sharing functionality), and WSO2 (for API Management / Console functionality).   

###User story

1. User navigates to bcdevexchange.org
2. User selects top level nav item 'Labs'
3. User sees a lab landing page listing all labs

The existing BCDevExchange.org app provides a use-case to justify the need for a lab space. Additional user stories will be gathered to help shape the evolution of the lab space / concept.  

###Mockup

Several ideas are being considered for how the Lab concept will be handled. The below mockup shows a lab landing page, accessed via BCDevExchange, which would provide links to different things in the lab.
