##Profiles

**Release 1:** A tool is being considered to allow users to search profiles based on certain criteria – such as credentials, skills, or accreditation – to allow users to find people instead of Resources or Projects via the exchange. Although the concept of Profiles will develop over time, the current proposed approach is for the development team to investigate ways to integrate with LinkedIn to use skills, credentials, and experience information that already exists, so users don’t have to maintain multiple skills profiles (leveraging what’s in LinkedIn), which would be made available to the BCDevExchange via registering / signing up with a LinkedIn account.  

**Future State:** All BCDevExchange users have at least one profile defaulted to their account, the Individual profile. Accounts may have additional profiles defined against them, each of which will correspond to membership in a BCDevExchange Organization. Each profile associated with an account is maintained separately, and may include details such as contact information, payment information, owned resources, resource interests, certifications / privileges, skills, and project history (all under discussion / to be determined). 
 
All Resources added to the BCDevExchange are done so in the context of a signed in user, and are created in the context of their currently selected profile. If the current profile is Individual, then the Resource is associated with and owned by that specific person, and Resource specific privileges (such as performing updates) are owned by that profile. If the current profile is an Organization specific profile, then the Resource is associated with and owned by that Organization, and any member of that Organization (with the appropriate Organization privileges) can maintain that Resource. 

###People Wanted
**Release 1** One of the requirements identified is the ability to post a ‘want ad’ sort of element, to try and find a member of BCDevExchange with certain skills or interests. It’s proposed that the GitHub Issues functionality (in the context of a Repo identifying the project in question – possibly in an Inspiration or Exploration state) be used to support this sort of posting. The issue could be labelled with something like ‘help wanted’, and be picked up through a search function on BCDevExchange.
