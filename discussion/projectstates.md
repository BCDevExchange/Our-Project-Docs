##Project States

**Release 1:** Each project has a current state / status, which is intended to give a rough indication of where the project is at, which are currently conceived as Research, Discovery, or Delivery. The project state / status will be prominently displayed in the user interface of the BCDevExchange website. See [State Labels](statelabels.md) for examples.

<a rel="Exploration" href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/docs/blob/master/discussion/projectstates.md"><img alt="Being designed and built, but in the lab.

May change, disappear, or be buggy." /></a> – Used to identify something that is in the process of being built, and can be interacted with in some way, though usually in the context of a lab, trial, or test. May have disclaimers regarding use, and may be temporary in nature. 

<a rel="Delivery" href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/docs/blob/master/discussion/projectstates.md"><img alt="In production, but maybe in Alpha or Beta. Intended to persist and be supported." style="border-width:0" src="https://assets.bcdevexchange.org/images/badges/delivery.svg" title="In production, but maybe in Alpha or Beta. Intended to persist and be supported." /></a> – Used to identify something that has been built out and in alpha, beta, or production, and can actually be used in some manner. Suggests some level of permanency and support for the product.

The benefits of this proposed model are to:

1. Identify what category something falls into,  for quick labelling / communication reasons

2. Use consistent language and labels to help create a framework for guiding developers in their projects

3. Help make things safer and more orderly for people using the model, as guidelines and disclaimers can be developed and associated based on their current state in the model

4. Provide a (very) high level SDLC (though projects may move from one state to another freely), that can be used to help communicate the current state of a resource or project 

5. Let people know what others are working on, to prevent duplicate effort, or to gain collaborators, elicit input, or increase awareness

**Future State:** Changes in a project status could be announced on BCDevExchange main page to help raise awareness. 

###BCDevExchange as a Project 

**Release 1:** This idea of a Project State / Status will be applied to aspects of BCDevExchange itself, and used to label ideas and functionality that are on the roadmap / backlog for the website itself. In a way, the development activities for BCDevExchange would consume and be supported by the framework that BCDevExchange is trying to create and facilitate. 

In support of the principles of open development and co-creation, it is proposed that the BCDevExchange website be enhanced to not only include functionality and content in the Delivery state, but also allow for the inclusion and sharing of functionality and content that is in the Exploration state (and possibly even the Inspiration state in some cases, such as content). Please see the [Lab](lab.md) page for more details.

**Future State:** In addition to analytics, we are exploring the idea of a ‘self identification’ process, which will increase the value of analytics data. The idea is to allow users to select the context in which they are interacting with the BCDevExchange (such as Entrepreneur, Developer, or Resource Provider, titles going through initial research and may change). It is thought that this will help guide the development team in creating navigation that provides the most value to future users. For example, users who identify as Developers may be more likely to want to search for Contract Opportunities, while those who identify as Entrepreneurs may be more likely to want to search for Unmet Business Needs (or whatever).
