This folder is intended to be used to circulate draft wireframes. 

.PNG files are images viewable by everyone, and are referenced by some of the .md files in docs/discussion 

.bmml files are Balsamiq files, which can be forked / edited by those with access to Balsamiq (the wireframe tool  used by some members of the BCDevExchange dev team). https://balsamiq.com/

We'd love to get your feedback on any of these wireframes. Soon you'll be able to sign up with [BCDevExchange](http://bcdevexchange.org/) to access the labs, and see some of these actually being developed.
